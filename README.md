# odin-weather

I am completing various small projects as part of the Odin Project. "Weather App" is the seventh project in the Full-stack Javascript course and the fifth project in the JavaScript course. This project primarily tests API usage (promises, async/await, fetch).

An update to this app could be made in the near future that will introduce an extended view as well as additional options.
